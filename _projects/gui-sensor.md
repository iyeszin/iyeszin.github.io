## Project Overview

This project involved developing a graphical user interface that enables users to create, visualize, and control various signals directly through an intuitive interface. The system provides immediate visual feedback and offers educational value for understanding signal processing concepts.

## Features Implemented

- Real-time signal generation with adjustable parameters
- Interactive visualization of signal properties
- Ability to apply various transformations to signals
- User-friendly controls with immediate visual feedback

## Design Considerations

The interface was designed with usability as a primary concern, ensuring that complex signal operations could be performed intuitively. This required careful planning of the control layout and real-time update mechanisms.

## Educational Value

Beyond its technical functionality, this GUI serves as an educational tool for demonstrating signal processing concepts in a hands-on way. Users can experiment with different parameters and see immediate results, making abstract concepts more tangible.

## Technologies Used

- Python for core functionality
- PyQt5 framework for GUI development
- Matplotlib for signal visualization
- NumPy for signal processing operations
