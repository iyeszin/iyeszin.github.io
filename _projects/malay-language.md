## Project Overview
This self-initiated project addresses the gap in structured Malay language learning resources for adult learners. I designed a comprehensive learning system following CEFR language proficiency standards while implementing it as an accessible web resource.

## Development Approach
- Researched effective language learning methodologies for adult learners
- Created a structured curriculum organized by proficiency levels (so far only for A1)
- Designed custom learning materials with authentic cultural context
- Implemented a filterable web interface using Jekyll collections

## Core Skills Demonstrated
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- **Instructional Design**: Applied adult learning theories to language acquisition
- **Content Creation**: Developed original, engaging learning materials
- **Information Architecture**: Structured complex linguistic concepts into learnable modules
- **Cross-Cultural Communication**: Bridged linguistic and cultural concepts for non-native learners
