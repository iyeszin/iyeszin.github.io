## Project Overview

This collaborative project focuses on enhancing human-robot interaction through improved emotional expressiveness in QTrobot, a humanoid robot designed for therapeutic and educational environments. The work emphasizes creating technology that adapts to human needs and enhances well-being.

## Current Focus

- Practise and get familiar with ROS 
- Evaluating effectiveness in real-world supportive contexts

## Human-Centered Approach

Rather than focusing solely on technical capabilities, this project prioritizes human needs and experiences. The robot is designed as a supportive tool that enhances human connection rather than replacing it, with continuous stakeholder input guiding development.

## Technologies Used

- Python and ROS for implementation
- User-centered design methodologies
- Participatory design with stakeholders
