## Project Overview

This self-initiated project involved designing and developing a personal portfolio website to showcase my work, skills, and professional journey. The site serves as both a digital resume and a platform to document my technical projects.

## Development Approach

- Designed a clean, responsive layout that works across all device sizes
- Implemented the site using Jekyll to create a maintainable, template-based structure
- Customized an existing theme to match my personal aesthetic while adding custom functionality
- Set up GitHub Pages for seamless deployment and updates
- Implemented collections to organize different types of content (projects, blog posts, etc.)

## Key Features

- Responsive design that adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop viewing
- Project showcase with filterable categories and detailed project pages
- Integrated blog functionality for sharing technical insights
- Performance optimization for fast loading times
- Contact form for professional inquiries

## Learning Outcomes

This project strengthened my web development skills while providing a platform to showcase my work. I gained experience with static site generators, version control workflows, and front-end design principles.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding interactive data visualizations for skill representation
- Implementing dark mode toggle functionality
- Creating internationalization support for multiple languages
