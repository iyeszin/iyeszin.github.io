## Project Overview

This project explored the optimization of convolutional neural networks for image classification tasks. Using the classic cats vs. dogs dataset, I investigated how architectural choices and hyperparameter selection affect both performance and computational efficiency.

## Key Aspects

- Designed and implemented a complete deep learning pipeline
- Conducted systematic experiments to understand the relationship between network architecture and performance
- Explored the balance between accuracy, model size, and computational requirements
- Applied transfer learning to leverage pre-existing knowledge representations

## Sustainability Considerations

The project included a focus on computational efficiency, recognizing that state-of-the-art deep learning often comes with significant environmental costs due to energy consumption. By optimizing hyperparameters, I achieved comparable results with reduced computational requirements.

## Technologies Used

- Python with TensorFlow for implementation
- Systematic experimentation methodology
- Data augmentation for improved model robustness
