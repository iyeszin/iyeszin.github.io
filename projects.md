			<h2>Completed Projects</h2>
		</header>
		<p></p>
		<p><b>Face recognition with PCA — <i>Python</i></b></p>
		<p>Study and implement Principal Component Analysis(PCA) on faces from paper "Eigenfaces for Recognition". Performed PCA on photographs of my faces.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p><b>Cats and dogs classification — <i>Python</i></b></p>
		<p>The Dogs vs. Cats dataset is a standard computer vision dataset that involves classifying photos as either containing a dog or cat. In this project, we are asked to design and implement machine learning pipeline on Dogs vs. Cats dataset. I build a Deep Convolutional Neural Network and experiment with different hyperparameter to obtain the best model.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p><b>Object counting  — <i>Python</i></b></p>
		<p>Apply the different concepts of morphological processing for object counting on a blood cells image.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p><b>Build a graphic user interface — <i>Python</i></b></p>
		<p>To create and control the signals directly from the GUI. The library I used to implement GUI is PyQt5.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p><b>Age and gender classification — <i>Python</i></b></p>
		<p>To replicate the experiment with adience dataset based on paper "Age and Gender Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks" by Levi and Hassner. Besides that, I also test the model with custom images.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p><b>Portfolio website — <i>HTML, Javascript, CSS</i></b></p>
		<p>Build an online resume static site hosted on github.io.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p><b>Count bottle in a crate — <i>Python</i></b></p>
		<p>To count bottles present in the images by taking input of image and output is the number of bottles in the crate. One of the challenges faces is identify and count the bottle in flipped and laying position.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p><b>Handwritten assamese numerals recognition — <i>Matlab</i></b></p>
		<p>The solution to this problem is handwritten digit recognition, which uses an image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image. In this project, we are going to recognize the handwritten assamese numerals by extracting useful features by analyzing the structure. </p>
		<p></p>
		<p><b>Information Retrieval: tf-idf — <i>Python</i></b></p>
		<p>This script implements the tf-idf in vector model to generate the tf-idf ratings for a collection of documents. This script can read a file (pdf files) from your computer.</p>

			<h2>Ongoing Projects</h2>
		</header>
		<p></p>
		<p><b>3D face generator using Deep-learning — Python</b></p>
		<p>The purpose is to generate realistic synthetic faces using deep-learning.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p><b>Transfer learning with Mask RCNN — Python</b></p>
		<p>Implement transfer learning with pretrained model on the COCO dataset, to detect custom object on images.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p><b>Implementation on Qtrobot — Python</b></p>
		<p>QTrobot is an expressive little humanoid designed as a tool for therapists and educators. Explore and experiment functionality of the robot. Implemented custom emotion on qtrobot in pair.</p>
