I've discovered that there isn't a structured language learning framework for adults studying Malay. Unlike many European languages that have clear CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) guidelines from A1 to C2, Malay lacks such widely standardized proficiency levels. This absence of standardized proficiency guidelines presents a challenge for course development.

Therefore, I would like to develop a framework to assist those interested in learning Malay.

There is a certificate for foreigners to test their proficiency level, called Sijil Kecekapan Bahasa Melayu bagi Warganegara Asing (SKBMW). Previously, there were minimum requirements to take the exam, such as having stayed in Malaysia for more than one year. However, this requirement has been removed in 2025 ((<a href="https://www.mpm.edu.my/images/dokumen/calon-peperiksaan/skbmw/Arahan_Dan_Panduan_Pendaftaran_Calon_SKBMW_2025.pdf">refer to this document</a>).). Now, everyone can take the exam online. Netherless, I have no idea of this certification, as I grew up speaking malay. 

### A1 Level Topics
(This A1 level framework is approximately designed by me to help learners, but it is not officially determined by any organization.)

I've been putting a lot of effort into learning German, and I also learn some French and Finnish. The grammar really make me a headache, it is such a PAIN to learn languages with gender, as i grew up learning languages without gender such as malay, mandarin and english(often referred to as a genderless language, it has masculine-feminine gendered distinctions in its lexicon). I always thought Malay was easy. But then I met someone who was struggling to learn Malay, and it made me realize that maybe it's not as simple as I thought, especially for adults who don't have a structured learning framework.

That's when I decided to create this course. Since I've taken A1 classes in German, French, and Finnish, I have a good idea of what should be covered at this level. Plus, having grown up with Malay and being immersed in its literature. 

So, here it isâ€”my attempt to make learning Malay a bit easier for adults. I hope you find it helpful, and I'm always open to feedback to make it better!
