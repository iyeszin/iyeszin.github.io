I've discovered that there isn't a structured language learning framework for adults studying Malay. Unlike many European languages that have clear CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) guidelines from A1 to C2, Malay lacks such widely standardized proficiency levels. This absence of standardized proficiency guidelines presents a challenge for course development.

Therefore, I would like to develop a framework to assist those interested in learning Malay.

There is a certificate for foreigners to test their proficiency level, called Sijil Kecekapan Bahasa Melayu bagi Warganegara Asing (SKBMW). Previously, there were minimum requirements to take the exam, such as having stayed in Malaysia for more than one year. However, this requirement has been removed in 2025 ((<a href="https://www.mpm.edu.my/images/dokumen/calon-peperiksaan/skbmw/Arahan_Dan_Panduan_Pendaftaran_Calon_SKBMW_2025.pdf">refer to this document</a>).). Now, everyone can take the exam online. Netherless, I have no idea of this certification, as I grew up speaking malay.
