It's with immense pride and a heart full of gratitude that I announce the completion of a remarkable chapter in my academic and professional journey: the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree in Photonics for Security, Reliability, and Safety (PSRS). This experience has been nothing short of transformative, blending rigorous scientific research with invaluable personal growth.

Our adventure through the PSRS program was a confluence of minds and spirits from every corner of the globe. Together, we delved into the complexities of photonics, uncovering its potential to make significant impacts in security, reliability, and safety. The diversity of our cohort, hailing from various backgrounds, enriched our discussions, projects, and collaborations, creating a fertile ground for innovation and understanding.

A pivotal moment of my journey was the opportunity to work on my master's thesis, "ROS2 based human-robot interaction framework using sign language," under the esteemed guidance of Prof. Dr. Elmar Rueckert and Fotios Lygerakis at the Chair of Cyber-Physical-Systems in Montanuniversität Leoben. This project aimed at bridging the communication gap for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community, by integrating sign language into robot interactions, thereby fostering a more inclusive human-robot interaction framework within ROS 2.

This journey would not have been possible without the unwavering support of our mentors, professors, and the vibrant PSRS community. Your encouragement, insights, and companionship have been the backbone of this experience.

As we celebrate this milestone, I am honored to share that I have been awarded the following degrees, marking the culmination of our hard work and dedication:

- Master of Science diploma in Optics, Image, Vision, Multimedia from Université Jean Monnet Saint-Etienne in France.
- Master of Science in Photonics from the University of Eastern Finland.
- Master of Science diploma in "Optics, Image, Vision, Multimedia" with a specialization in "Biometrics and Intelligent Vision" from Université Paris-Est Créteil (UPEC) in France.

With our graduation, we stand at the threshold of the future, ready to leverage our knowledge and skills in the realm of human-centered artificial intelligence. The international exposure, networking, and academic accomplishments we've gained position us uniquely to contribute meaningfully to any organization.

To my coursemates, congratulations on this significant achievement! Our journey together has been a source of inspiration and strength. As we venture into the next chapters of our lives, I am excited to see the impact we will make in our fields.

To everyone who has been a part of this journey, thank you for your support, guidance, and belief in us. The future beckons with open arms, and I am eager to embrace it with the same zeal and passion that carried us through our Erasmus Mundus adventure.
