Hello! My journey into the tech world began with a deep dive into Biometrics and Intelligent Vision, thanks to the Erasmus Mundus Master degree program I joined in 2021. That summer, I was fortunate to immerse myself in an internship at the Color Imaging Laboratory in Granada, Spain, exploring the frontiers of computer vision.

Now, having completed my master's, I've embarked on a PhD in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at Montanuniversit√§t Leoben in Austria. Here, I'm delving into the complexities of machine learning, facing new challenges head-on and learning every step of the way.

But life isn't all about tech for me. I believe in a well-rounded lifestyle, so outside the lab, I'm often found practising yoga, studying language, or in the kitchen trying to master the art of my home country's cuisine. Cooking has become a delightful venture into my cultural roots.

I'm on the lookout for opportunities where I can apply my passion for computer vision and AI in practical settings, especially if it involves collaborative projects or research internships that are aligned with my academic pursuits.

So, here's a brief snapshot of who I am: a tech enthusiast with a zest for tackling new challenges, eager to blend my academic interests with real-world applications, all while keeping grounded with hobbies that enrich my life beyond the screen.
