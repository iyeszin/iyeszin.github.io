![myself]({{ site.url | absolute_path}}/assets/images/pic06.JPG)

Hello! My journey into the tech world began with a deep dive into Biometrics and Intelligent Vision through the Erasmus Mundus Master degree program in 2021. That summer, I had the opportunity to intern at the Color Imaging Laboratory in Granada, Spain, where I explored the frontiers of computer vision.

After completing my master's, I pursued a PhD in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at Montanuniversität Leoben in Austria. Although I recently decided to take a break from my PhD, the experience equipped me with valuable skills in research, project management, and cross-disciplinary collaboration.

I'm passionate about languages, cultures, and diverse perspectives to create meaningful connections. With my background, I am now eager to contribute to international organizations in a support role, such as a program coordinator, where I can leverage my organizational skills and cultural sensitivity. I believe in the power of effective communication and coordination to drive successful projects and initiatives.

Beyond the professional realm, I believe in a well-rounded lifestyle. Outside of work, you'll often find me practicing yoga, studying languages, or in the kitchen trying to master the art of my home country's cuisine. Cooking has become a delightful venture into my cultural roots.

While I am currently focused on support roles, I am open to pursuing another PhD in the future if I find a suitable topic and environment that align with my interests and values.

So, here's a brief snapshot of who I am: a passionate individual with a background in technology and research, eager to bring my skills to a supportive role, all while keeping grounded with hobbies that enrich my life beyond work.

Now, having completed my master's, I've embarked on a PhD in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at Montanuniversität Leoben in Austria. Here, I'm delving into the complexities of machine learning, facing new challenges head-on and learning every step of the way.

But life isn't all about tech for me. I believe in a well-rounded lifestyle, so outside the lab, I'm often found practising yoga, studying language, or in the kitchen trying to master the art of my home country's cuisine. Cooking has become a delightful venture into my cultural roots.

I'm on the lookout for opportunities where I can apply my passion for computer vision and AI in practical settings, especially if it involves collaborative projects or research internships that are aligned with my academic pursuits.

So, here's a brief snapshot of who I am: a tech enthusiast with a zest for tackling new challenges, eager to blend my academic interests with real-world applications, all while keeping grounded with hobbies that enrich my life beyond the screen. -->
