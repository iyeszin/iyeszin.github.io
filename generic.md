Coming from a computer science background, I joined the Erasmus Mundus Master program in 2021 aiming at specializing in Biometrics and Intelligent Vision. During the summer, I was offered an internship at the Color Imaging Laboratory at the University of Granada in Spain. Currently, Iâ€™m looking for a paid opportunity for my master thesis job/ research internship related to computer vision. I like to solve problems and taking on new challenges. Pushing myself to take risks and stepping out of my comfort zone is how I continue to grow.

My available time for the internship starts from beginning of February 2023. 

Alongside my interests in computer vision some of my other interests and hobbies are:
- Yoga
- Cycling
- Becoming better in cooking home country dishes
