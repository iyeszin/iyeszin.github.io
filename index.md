<!-- Coming from a computer science background, I joined the Erasmus Mundus Master program in 2021 aiming at specializing in Biometrics and Intelligent Vision. Currently, Iâ€™m looking for 13 weeks-long summer internship to gain real-life exposure and grow my knowledge in signal processing. I like to solve problems and taking on new challenges. Pushing myself to take risks and stepping out of my comfort zone is how I continue to grow.
